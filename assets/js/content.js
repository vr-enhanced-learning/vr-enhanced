localStorage.setItem("summarization", `While cockroaches are often considered to be the winners in a post-nuclear world, fungi may actually be
the ones thriving in highly radioactive conditions. Melanin-rich fungi found inside the Chernobyl
reactor are attracted to radiation and use their melanin as a shield while also absorbing energy from
the radiation to enhance their growth. These fungi could potentially be used to clean up radioactive
waste and develop new cancer treatments. Therefore, if there is a nuclear accident, fungi might be able
to survive and help clean up the aftermath.`)
