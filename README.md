## First Review
- [ ] Alpha Rendering Engine extending WebGL
- [x] QuickXR - Custom WebXR framework (a-frame is not so cool, slow, non-use case specific)
- [x] TURB Phase - 1: Answer Generation from Question and Context (superior to BERT - add in graphs and tables showing it)
- [x] STIR 50% - Support Mesh Creation (show tables and graphs if any)
- [x] Asset Generation and TURB model deployment
- [x] VR Environment (Desktop and Headset supported) for context and question input from user with `Web Speech API`
- [x] Integration with WebXR and building VR UI components


## Second Review
- [ ] Rendering Engine - Beta Candidate
- [x] 75% or use-case dependent component completion of QuickXR
- [x] TURB Phase - 2: Context based questions generator. Integration with Sub model from Phase 1
- [ ] STIR 75 - 90% implementation - all complete except hyper parameter fine tuning
- [x] Phase 2 Model deployment
- [x] Web Player implementation
- [x] QuickXR integration, web player integration, context extraction - declarative and model-based

## Third Review
- [ ] Rendering Engine - Release Candidate
- [x] QuickXR - Release Candidate
- [x] TURB Phase - 3: Context based summary generator. Integration with Sub model from Phase 1 & 2
- [x] STIR 100% with edge caching and hyper parameter fine tuning
- [x] Phase 3 Model deployment
- [x] QuickXR bridge with STIR and TURB
